**Intrusion-Detection-System**
A Python-based IDS that detects ICMP flood attacks and TCP port scans in real-time using Scapy, with alerts logged and visual ICMP proof captured via Wireshark.
It also includes:
- üìÑ Real-time alerts saved in a log file
- üñ•Ô∏è A separate `alerts_only.py` file for live monitoring of alerts
- ü¶à Wireshark `.pcapng` file to visualize ICMP traffic

üìÅ **Project Structure**
Smart_IDS_Project/

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ smart_ids.py # Main IDS with ICMP + Port Scan detection 

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alerts_only.py # Real-time display of alerts from log file 

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alerts_only_log.txt # Log file storing detected attacks 

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ icmp loopback capture.pcapng # Wireshark capture of ICMP packets 


**How It Works**

### 1. Packet Sniffing (Scapy)
- Captures live packets using `scapy`
- Analyzes for ICMP floods and TCP port scan behavior

### 2. ICMP Flood Detection
- Tracks the number of pings (ICMP packets) per IP within a short window
- Triggers alert if threshold is crossed

### 3. TCP Port Scan Detection
- Tracks how many **unique ports** an IP hits within 5 seconds
- If more than 2, it logs a port scan alert

### 4. Logging + Real-time Monitoring
- Alerts are written to `alerts_only_log.txt`
- You can monitor new alerts live using `alerts_only.py`



## üß™ How to Simulate Attacks

### ‚û§ Simulate Port Scan using `nmap`:
nmap -p 21,22,23,25,80,110,443,8080 127.0.0.1

### ‚û§ Simulate ICMP Flood using ping:
ping 127.0.0.1 -t -l 1000
This sends continuous ping requests (ICMP Echo) to your own system, simulating a flood attack.
Use Wireshark with the loopback adapter and icmp filter to visually confirm the attack traffic.



### **Programming Language**:

Python 3.6+ - scapy (For packet sniffing and protocol analysis)


### **Cybersecurity Concepts**:

Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

ICMP Flood Detection (Ping Flood)

TCP Port Scan Detection

Threshold-based alert logic

Real-time monitoring & alert logging

### **Tools for Simulation & Testing**:

nmap ‚Äì To simulate port scanning attacks

ping ‚Äì To simulate ICMP flood attacks (ping -t -l 1000)

Wireshark ‚Äì For capturing and visualizing ICMP traffic

### **Editor & Platform**:

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Command Prompt (CMD)

Windows OS (with administrator privileges)

### **Files in the Project**:
- `smart_ids.py` ‚Äì Main IDS detection logic
- `alerts_only.py` ‚Äì Real-time alert monitor
- `alerts_only_log.txt` ‚Äì Logged alerts output
- `icmp loopback capture.pcapng` ‚Äì Wireshark ICMP flood capture

### üìÑ Note:
The file alerts_only_log.txt will be automatically created when you run smart_ids.py.
It stores all detected intrusion alerts in real-time.
